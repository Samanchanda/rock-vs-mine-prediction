# 🌊 Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify underwater sonar signals as either *rock* or *mine*. The system is built using a labeled sonar dataset and trained with logistic regression.

## 📁 Project Overview

This notebook includes:

- Loading and exploring the *Sonar Dataset* from UCI ML repository
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Logistic Regression model training
- Evaluation using accuracy score

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset contains 208 sonar signal readings. Each instance represents 60 frequency features followed by a label:
- *R* = Rock
- *M* = Mine

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open in Google Colab.
2. Ensure dataset is present or linked.
3. Run all cells in the notebook step-by-step.

## 📊 Results

- Model Accuracy: *~88%*
- Binary classification task with strong performance on real-world sonar data.

## 🛠 Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, etc.)
